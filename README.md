## Installation

To install the extension you first need to clone this repository locally using:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ksec-project/git-ksec.git
```

Then you need to add the new folder to $PATH, for this you need to add the following line to your command shell profile:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/folder/git-ksec
```

If you don't know how to get this path just go to your git-ksec folder, open your terminal from there and run:
```bash
pwd
```

git will automatically add the new extensions
